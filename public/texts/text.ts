Prepare your return

1. Place the item inside the FARFETCH packaging – don't forget any brand boxes, dust bags, or cases
2. Attach your Return Label to the outside of the FARFETCH packaging. 
3. If you received a Return Note with your order, attach it to the outside of your package
4. Give the Waybill Doc to the courier. Make a note of the Waybill Number to track your return
5. When your package is collected or dropped off, make sure you ask the courier to scan the label so you can track your return.

All the documents you need to return your item should be included in your FARFETCH package. If you need to reprint them, head to Orders & Returns in your account, or if you placed an order as a guest, enter your guest order details here
